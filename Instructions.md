# Instructions

## Object
To accumulate capital by skillfully buying and selling shares of stock at continually changing prices

## Before the game starts
Place the quation board indicator on the center of the board on top of the word **Start**, "up" toward **Up** and "down" toward **Down**. Players choose playing pieces and decide who should be banker broker. If desired these can be two separate players. Banker Broker arranges all the money and stock before play. If one player is banker and another is broker, broker handles the shares and banker handles the money.

## Starting the game
Each player must "go to work". They select one of the four occupations shown on the corners of the board and outs their playing piece on that square.Players may choose the same occupation and may change occupation at any time before the throw of the dice. Banker has first throw of the dice. Play then moves to the left. No matter who throws the dice, a player receives the salary shown every time the required number for their occupation turns up. Once a player has earned $1,000 he may recive a salary only until their next turn when they must begin playing the market. They may begin before they have earned $1,000 but in most cases will not get a good start. Players who are still "at work" continue to get a salary every time their number comes up.

## Playing the market
A player, at thier turn to throw the dice, places their playing piece on any one of the four squares (center of each side) where the word **Start** is found. They do not pay a fee to start. They throw the dice and move their playing piece the number of squares in the direction indicated. (**Start** squares have two arrows, one for odd and one for even numbers.) **Each time they throw the dice thereafter, they follow the direction of the arrow in the square they are leaving**

## Buying stock
As each player lands on a new square, they immediately move the quotation board indicator up or down the number of required spaces as indicated in that square. If the quotation board indicator should reach the top or the bottom if the board, the direction of counting is reversed, and the remaining spaces are counted off in the opposite direction. After the quotation board indicator has been moved, a player may purchase from the bank as many shares as he wishes of the stock named in that square at the new quotation price per share. When a player buys one or more shares of stock, they get a share name-card and share scrip showing the number of shares purchased; these are both placed together before them. Only one share may be bought on squares where a limit is shown and no shares bought upon landing on a **$100 Fee** or **Broker Fee** square or on a square requiring sale of a stock. A player landing on one of these squares must follow instructions given in the square before the next player may roll the dice, even if they must sell stock out of turn and take the lowest board price. A payer may choose not to buy any shares when they land on a new square. However, it is important to remember that **a player may purcase stock only immediately upon landing on a new square and before the dice are passed on to a new player**.

If a player lands on a square where they already onw some of the stock listed, they receive a cash dividend from the bank for each share at the dividend price listed on the square. They may also buy additional shares at the new quotation board price per share. they do not receive a dividend for these new shares on this turn.

## Selling stock
Immediately before their turn to throw the dice, a player may sell any of their shares back to the bank at the quotation board price. No shares may be sold between players. If they sell out of turn, they must sell at the lowest price on the board for each particular stock, no matter what the current price may be

## Stock dividends
For each stock there is one entrance to a **stockholders meeting**. A player who owns a share or more of the stock named must detour into the meeting if they land on the entrance. They may buy only one share and at their next turn must proceed through the meeting. If a player does not own any of the the stock it is usually to thier advantage to buy the one share and go to the meeting. If they land on any of the meeting spaces the quotation board remains unchanged and they recuve a stock dividend of as many shares as indicated for each of the shares they own of that stock. They cannot buy any shares while at the meeting.

## Going broke
If a player goes broke or cannot pay a fee they may go back "to work" provided they return all their remaining stock and money back to the bank

## Winning the game
To win, a player must hav $100,000 at their turn to roll the dice. This includes their cash and all of thier stock at the current board price. If they wish, players may set a smaller or larger amount to lengthen or shorten the game. They might also decide that the player with the most money after a specified lenth of time would be the winner.

## Points to remember
* Stock may be purchased only immediately upon landing on a new square and before the next player throws the dice.
* Stock may be sold for the current price only if sold immediatly before the player's turn to throw the dice. Otherwise it must be sold out of turn for the lowest price shown on the board.
* Players never throw dice twice in a row, even on doubles.
* If the quotation board indicator should reach the top or bottom of the board, the direction of counting is simply reversed and the remaining points are counted off in the opposite direction.
* No shares may be sold between players
